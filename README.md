# Brute Force Detection Engine

This project simulates a security engineering system that detects brute-force login attempts and automatically responds by blocking malicious IP addresses.

## What This Project Does
- Parses authentication logs
- Detects repeated failed login attempts
- Uses thresholds to identify brute-force behavior
- Automatically blocks suspicious IP addresses
- Logs all security actions

## Security Concepts Used
- System hardening
- Preventive, detective, and corrective controls
- Defense-in-depth
- Security automation using Python

## Why This Matters
Brute-force attacks are one of the most common threats to systems. Automating detection and response reduces human error and reaction time.

## Tools & Skills
- Python
- Log analysis
- Security automation
- Threat detection
